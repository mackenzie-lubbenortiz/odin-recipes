    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This lasagna recipe is easy to make with a creamy ricotta cheese mixture,
      savory meat sauce, and mozzarella cheese. BONUS: you can make-ahead and it
      is freezer-friendly!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Cheese filling</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese, <em>2 cups</em></li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>3/4 cup parmesan cheese, <em>freshly grated</em></li>
      <li>2 teaspoons italian seasoning</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Meat Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 yellow onion, <em>finely diced</em></li>
      <li>3/4 lb. ground beef</li>
      <li>3/4 lb. ground italian sausage</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, <em>minced</em></li>
      <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>40 oz. marinara sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Lasagna Noodles/Cheese Topping</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>12 lasagna noodles, <em>plus extra in case of breakage</em></li>
      <li>2.5 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set aside.
        Measure out remaining ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them
        soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which
        is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a
        spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook
        for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last
        minute. Drain excess grease.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom
        and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce,
        and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.
        Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta
        noodles.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Preheat oven to 375°.</strong></li>
      <li>
        Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water for the lasagna noodles.
        Once a rapid boil is reached, cook the noodles to al dente according to
        package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you don’t overcook them.)
        Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to prevent the
        noodles from sticking. Drain and rinse with cold water until noodles are
        completely cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin
        assembling the lasagna.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch
        casserole dish. Next, add 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping them if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by
        about 1 ½ cups of meat sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top with 4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 ½
        cups meat sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finish with 4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture, and
        the rest of the meat sauce.
      </li>
      <li>Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese.</li>
      <li>
        Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray and place it spray-side-down on
        top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake for 35 minutes.</strong> Remove cover and bake for
        <strong>10 more minutes.</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. Let it sit for 15 minutes prior
        to serving to allow the layers to set.
      </li>
